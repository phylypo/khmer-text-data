# khmer-text-data
Khmer unicode text data for unsupervised learning language model

This goal of this repos is to collect Khmer text that can be use to train Khmer language model. 
These data are already segmented using Conditional Random Fields ([CRF](https://github.com/phylypo/segmentation-crf-khmer/tree/master/data)).


Some of the Khmer news articles can be found here:

It also contains some sample code to train BERT from scrach. 
See this python Notebook contain step by step pretrain BERT on Khmer language:
